# Haskell Programming from First Principles Exercise Solutions

My solutions to the exercises found in [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki

This book is Early Access, the problems referenced are not given in full here and are subject to change.

All code given compiles and produces expected results.

TODOs are areas I'd like to refactor eventually but have moved on from for now
